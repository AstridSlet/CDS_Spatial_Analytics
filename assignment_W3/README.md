# W3 - Spatial Operations with Vector data

## Assignment description 
Now that you know the basics of vector data operations, use the HW exercise (html attached below) to download online datasets of ancient cities and inscriptions, wrangle them into good spatial shape and extract meaning out of their relation.

Tasks 1-6 provide a scaffolding for the exercises that encapsulate spatial data creation, projection, and intersection. You need to provide solutions and answer the associated questions 1-3.
Optional/Challenge Tasks 7-8 take you a couple steps further to contiguity checking and distance calculations with question 4-7.


__Answers to question 1-6 can be found in the CitiesInscriptions_exercise.Rmd at this repository.__
