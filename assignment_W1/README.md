# W1 - Make me an interactive map

## Assignment description 
1. Answer: Describe a problem or question in your field for which spatial analysis could be applicable.

2. Answer: List 5 data layers that you think are necessary to answer your question/solve your problem. Find on the internet github.and then describe examples of two or three of your listed layers.

3. Code: Your colleague has found some ruins during a hike in the Blue Mountains and recorded the coordinates of structures on her phone(RCFeature.csv). She would like to map her points but has no computer or mapping skills. Can you make a map that she can work with using only a browser? She needs an interactive map that she can download to her computer and use straightaway.

  4. Create a standalone .html map in Leaflet showing at least basic topography and relief, and load in the table of points. Make  sure she can see the FeatureID, FeatureType and Description attributes when she hovers over the point markers.

  5. Consider adding elements such as minimap() and measure() for easier map interaction

  6. Explore differentiating the markers (e.g. by size using Accuracy field)

  7. Explore the option of clustering markers with addMarkers(clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions()). Do you recommend marker clustering here?
